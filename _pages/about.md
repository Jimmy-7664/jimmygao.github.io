I'm a first year Phd student from [Department of Information and Communication Engineering](https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/course/ice/admission_e.shtml), [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index.html). My research interest includes spatial-temporal forecasting, time-series forecasting, spatial-temporal data mining, and foundation models.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kenjiro Taura](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/ja/people/people000415.html) and [Prof. Renhe Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yo2lwasAAAAJ&hl=en). 

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
